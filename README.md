## Overview
Los Angeles is a large commuter city which inherently lends itself to numerous traffic collisions. 
Car crashes are one of the leading causes of death in the US(1) and as such they are an ideal candidate for study. Studying a leading cause of death may unveil insights which may help prevent or reduce deaths due to traffic collisions.
<br> </br>
Objective: Analyze data from LA County database regarding traffic collisions in LA County. We will create a dashboard page with multiple graphs updating from the same data. This facilitates visual analyzation of the data.


## Step 1: Data Source
 
The city of Los Angeles has made collision data available to the public.
<br>
Original data source: https://data.lacity.org/A-Safe-City/Traffic-Collision-Data-from-2010-to-Present/d5tf-ez2w
<br>
## Step 2: Data Munging
Clean data by removing unnecessary columns and adding a day of the week column to facilitate analysis.
    
## Step 3: Store data in database
We utilized SQLite to store the data.

## Step 4: Create Dashboard page with graphs
The Dashboard page will contain an analysis of the relationships gender, age, and time have with collisions in Los Angeles.
## Step 5: Analyze data
We found that men are more likely to get in traffic collisions than women and that people tend to get in more accidents on friday afternoons.
